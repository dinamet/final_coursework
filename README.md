Description:
This project is a console-based Tourist Destination Catalog that allows users to add, view, update, delete, save tourist destination data, generates reports, provides search and sort functionalities.

Objectives:
Help users manage a list of travel destinations. Allow basic CRUD operations with data validation. Enable report generation and activity tracking.

Documentation:
This project implements a simple tourist destination catalog with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Java. The core data structure used is an ArrayList to store Destination objects, each containing information such as location, accommodation, cost, climate, safety, and attractions.

Data Structures:
ArrayList, Scanner, File I/O.

Methods:
addDestination, viewDestinations, updateDestination, deleteDestination, saveToFile, loadFromFile, showReport.

Challenges:
To be honest, this coursework was very difficult for me because I don't understand this programming language properly. I realized again that I can't write all the code myself, so it's sad.
